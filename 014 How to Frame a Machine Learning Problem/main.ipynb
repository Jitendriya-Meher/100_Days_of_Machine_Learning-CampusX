    "✅ 1. Define the Business or Research Objective\n",
    "What are you trying to achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "How will success be measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example: “Reduce customer churn by predicting which users are likely to cancel their subscriptions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Translate the Objective into a Machine Learning Task\n",
    "Classification → Is the output a category? (e.g., spam vs. not spam)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression → Is the output a number? (e.g., predicting house prices)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering → No labels, group similar data (e.g., customer segmentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation → Suggest items to users (e.g., Netflix or Amazon)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly Detection → Identify unusual patterns or outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. Identify Input and Output\n",
    "Input (Features): What data do you have? (e.g., age, income, past purchases)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output (Label): What do you want to predict? (e.g., churn = yes/no)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. Check the Availability and Quality of Data\n",
    "Is the data labeled?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the data clean and complete?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there enough data to train a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Note: No data → no ML. Low-quality data → bad ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 5. Decide on Supervised or Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised Learning: You have input-output pairs (e.g., image + label).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning: You only have input (e.g., clustering customer behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns by interacting with an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 6. Determine the Evaluation Metric\n",
    "Choose a metric based on the goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression: RMSE, MAE, R²\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranking: NDCG, MAP\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example: In fraud detection, recall is more important than accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 7. Identify Constraints and Requirements\n",
    "Time (real-time vs. batch predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources (memory, CPU/GPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability (is explainability important?)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 8. Think About Deployment and Use\n",
    "Where will this model be used? (web app, mobile app, dashboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "How often will it be retrained or updated?\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 Example Framing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Problem: Reduce loan default rate\n",
    "\n",
    "ML Task: Binary classification\n",
    "Input Features: Age, income, credit score, loan amount\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Label: Default (yes/no)\n",
    "\n",
    "Metric: F1-score or ROC-AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints: Must run on a mobile device (lightweight model)"
