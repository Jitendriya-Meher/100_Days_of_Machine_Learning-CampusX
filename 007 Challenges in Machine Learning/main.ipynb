    "⚠️ 1. Quality and Quantity of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: ML models need large, high-quality, and relevant data to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing, noisy, or inconsistent data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced classes (e.g., 95% negative, 5% positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited labeled data for supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 2. Overfitting & Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: The model memorizes training data, performing poorly on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting: The model is too simple and fails to capture underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚖️ 3. Bias and Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Biased data leads to biased models, which can reinforce unfair outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender or racial bias in hiring or loan approval models\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 4. Model Interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Complex models (like deep learning) can act like \"black boxes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Hard to explain how decisions are made — a major concern in fields like healthcare or finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "📉 5. Generalization to New Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Models may perform well on training data but fail in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason: Distribution shift — when the test data differs from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 6. Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Choosing the right evaluation metrics and validation strategies (e.g., cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Misleading accuracy if test data isn't representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠️ 7. Algorithm & Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: No one-size-fits-all algorithm — different problems require different techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Requires experimentation and expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "💻 8. Computational Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Training large models (e.g., deep neural networks) requires powerful hardware (GPUs/TPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Cost and accessibility limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔐 9. Security and Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Handling sensitive data while complying with laws (e.g., GDPR).\n",
    "\n",
    "Risks: Data breaches, model inversion attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "🌎 10. Deployment and Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge: Moving from a trained model to a production-ready system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring model drift\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating models over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with existing systems"
